## ðŸŽ² Number Guessing Game

This is a Python script for a simple number guessing game. You guess a number between 1 and 10, and the computer tells you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## ðŸŒŸ What I Learned

- **Loops (`while` loop):** How to keep the game going until the right number is guessed.
- **Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`):** How to check if the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
- **Python's `random` Library:** To make the game interesting by having the computer pick a random number every time.
- **Input and Output:** Getting the player's guess and showing messages.
